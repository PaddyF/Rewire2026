# Rewire 2026

Native SwiftUI iOS app for tracking the [Rewire festival](https://rewire.nl) lineup — The Hague, 9–12 April 2026.

## Features

- **Lineup** — searchable, filterable list of 166 artists with wave badges, genre tags, and performance types
- **My List** — bookmarked and rated artists, sorted by Must See rating
- **Planner** — shows your picks now; switches to a day-by-day schedule grid once the timetable drops, with conflict detection for overlapping bookmarked slots

Each artist detail view has:
- 5-star "Must See" rating (persists across app restarts)
- Personal notes text field (persists across app restarts)
- Bookmark toggle
- Hero image (when `image_url` is populated), release info, bio, Plus Ticket warning, World Premiere badge
- Schedule conflict warning (once timetable data exists)

## Requirements

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 17+ target (simulator or physical device)
- No third-party dependencies

## Build & Run

```bash
cd ~/Developer/Rewire2026
open Rewire2026.xcodeproj
```

Select your device or simulator, hit **Run** (⌘R). A free Apple ID works for personal device deployment (no paid developer account needed).

```

## Updating Artist Data

All source data lives in `Data/lineup.yaml`. The pipeline is:

```
Data/lineup.yaml  →  Data/fill_gaps.py  →  Data/lineup.json  →  Rewire2026/Resources/lineup.json
```

See `Data/README.md` for full workflow details.

### Quick update

```bash
cd ~/Developer/Rewire2026/Data
# edit lineup.yaml as needed, then:
python build.py
cp lineup.json ../Rewire2026/Resources/lineup.json
# rebuild in Xcode (⌘R)
```

### When the timetable drops

Populate `day`, `time`, and `stage` on each slot in `lineup.yaml`, then rebuild. The Planner tab automatically switches from the "coming soon" placeholder to a schedule grid once any slot has a `day` value.

## Data Model

### Slot (from JSON — one per performance)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `displayName` | String | Billing name for the performance |
| `wave` | String | "W1" / "W2" / "W3" |
| `type` | String? | Live / DJ Set / Installation / Live A/V… |
| `worldPremiere` | Bool | True if a world premiere |
| `day` | String? | "Thu" / "Fri" / "Sat" / "Sun" — nil until timetable |
| `stage` | String? | Venue/stage name — nil until timetable |
| `time` | String? | "22:30" format — nil until timetable |
| `isCollab` | Bool | Two or more artists sharing a slot |
| `artistIds` | [String] | Slugs referencing entries in `artists` dict |
| `project` | String? | Collab project name if named |

### Artist (from JSON — one per individual, reused across slots)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | String | Display name |

### UserArtistData (SwiftData — persisted on device)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `artistId` | String | Foreign key → `Slot.displayName` |
| `mustSeeRating` | Int | 0 = unrated, 1–5 |
| `personalNotes` | String | Free text, saves on type |
| `isBookmarked` | Bool | Appears in My List and Planner |
